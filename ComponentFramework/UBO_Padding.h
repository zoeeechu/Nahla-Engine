/*** A Uniform Buffer Object declares a block of GPU memory that can be used
to store any kind of data you wish. That data can then be used in any number of
shaders that needs it.

The twist is that between the CPU and the GPU the sizes of each chunk of data
must have the size and layout on both devices. To accomplish this, a set of rules
that standardize memory sizes and layout was astablished known as std140. The
full set of rules can be found here:
https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_uniform_buffer_object.txt

Below, is a set of const sizes for most the data used in Graphics programming based
on std140. Notice that even a bool if 4 bytes long and both Vec3 and Vec4 are 16 bytes.
